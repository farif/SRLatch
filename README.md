## SR Latch (flip-flop) Design in Lustre

The SR flip-flop, also known as a SR Latch, is one of the most basic sequential logic circuit.
It is one-bit memory device that has two inputs, labeled “Set/S” (meaning the output = “1”), and “Reset/R” (meaning the output = “0”).

Try the [SR Latch model](https://github.com/farif/SRLatch/blob/main/SRLatch.lus) to check the bistable property using online model checker [Kind2](https://kind.cs.uiowa.edu/app)
